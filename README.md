# New Tab Override (browser.newtab.url replacement)

### Description
With Firefox 41 (and higher), it's no longer possible to customize the page shown in a new tab via changing the
preference browser.newtab.url in about.config. Because of the fact that hijackers abused the preference in the past,
Mozilla decided to remove it (see [bug 1118285](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1118285)). Fortunately,
by removing it, Mozilla also introduced a new API to bring this functionality back to life as an add-on. This add-on
allows the user to choose a certain page in a new tab.
